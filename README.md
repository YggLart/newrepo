# âœ¨ About this
- This is a `first project` a wanted to finish to show my resume in a nice way to have some kind of portfolio during my early days as I was learning web development.
- Made the design using Figma and even posted the project at my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/142072593/Interactive-Resume) before actually coding it.
- I'm proud of it, but it's outdated.
